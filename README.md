# make_art
Turn into Van Gogh with this amazing function!
All you have to do is choose a number to set the seed and ensure reproducibility, e.g. make_art(seed = 123).
Then this beautiful function will generate a moving polygon with random colors and shapes or a pointillistic masterpiece!
Either way, it will be unique to you. Some even say that the colors are chosen based on the mood you are in...
